*** Instructions for building global Pb from source code. ***

To compile global Pb from source, you will need to download 3 packages:

(1) The current globalPb distribution with precompiled mex files.
    http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/gpb/globalPb.tar.gz
    You will still need the scripts from this package even though we are replacing the 
    mex files.

(2) This package, containing source code for the mex files, which you downloaded from:
    http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/gpb/gpb_src.tar.gz
    You will replace the mex files in (1) with those you compile from this source.

(3) The Berkeley Segmentation Engine (BSE)
    http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fowlkes/BSE/
    You will replace the "segment" program in (1) with the "segment" program compiled
    from the BSE source.

Next, follow steps A, B, and C below.

-- STEP A --
To build the mex files from (2) (this package):

(i)   Edit Rules.make

      Edit the following line in Rules.make to point to the directory where matlab 
      is installed (example given below):

      MATLAB_PATH := /usr/sww/pkg/matlab-r2007a

      Also, if you are using a 32-bit instead of a 64-bit architecture, uncomment
      the lines specifying 32-bit architecture and comment the lines specifying
      64-bit:

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (32-bit machines)
      MATLAB_ARCH := glnx86
      MEX_EXTN := mexglx

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (64-bit machines)
      #MATLAB_ARCH := glnxa64
      #MEX_EXTN := mexa64

(ii)  Type the following make commands:

      make
      make matlab

(iii) The mex files needed for globalPb can be found in the matlab/segmentation/
      subdirectory.  Copy these .mexa64 (or .mexglx for 32-bit) files into the 
      lib/ subdirectory of package (1), replacing the precompiled mex files.

-- STEP B --
To build the segment program from (3):

(i)   Follow the instructions included in (3) for compiling from source.

(ii)  Copy the "segment" executable into the lib/ subdirectory of (1), 
      replacing the precompiled "segment" executable.

-- STEP C --
You should now be able to run the example.m file in (1), which computes global Pb
on an example image.
