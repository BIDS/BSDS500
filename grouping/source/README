Follow these steps to compile the grouping software from source code:

(i)   Edit the file    gpb_src/Rules.make

      Edit the following line in Rules.make to point to the directory where matlab 
      is installed (example given below):

      MATLAB_PATH := /opt/matlab-r2010a

      Also, if you are using a 32-bit instead of a 64-bit architecture, uncomment
      the lines specifying 32-bit architecture and comment the lines specifying
      64-bit:

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (32-bit machines)
      MATLAB_ARCH := glnx86
      MEX_EXTN := mexglx

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (64-bit machines)
      #MATLAB_ARCH := glnxa64
      #MEX_EXTN := mexa64

(ii)  For Mac OSX 64-bit:
         In gpb_src/Rules.make, uncomment the OSX specific definitions of:
         CXX_BUILD, MATLAB_ARCH, MEX_EXTN, MEX_LDFLAGS (and comment the default definitions)

         Likewise, in buildW/Makefile, uncomment the OSX specific definition of CXX

(iii) Type the following commands:

         source build.sh

      This script should build all the packages and copy the resulting .mex files
      into the ../lib directory.

You should now be able to run the example.m file which computes global Pb
on an example image.
