# Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Benchmarks 500 (BSDS500)

## Overview

The goal of this work is to provide an empirical basis for research on image
segmentation and boundary detection. In order to promote scientific progress
in the study of visual grouping, we provide the following resources:

- A large dataset of natural images that have been manually segmented. The
  human annotations serve as ground truth for learning grouping cues as well
  as a benchmark for comparing different segmentation and boundary detection
  algorithms.

- The most recent algorithms our group has developed for contour detection and
  image segmentation.

- Performance evaluation of the leading computational approaches to grouping.

This is a mirror of the January 2013 update.
